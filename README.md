# Apple qualities
The dataset contains characteristics such as size, weight, sweetness, crispness, juiciness, ripeness, acidity, and quality.
Based on the input numerical data, the model estimates what the quality of the apple will be (good/bad) in the end.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 4000 rows. The parameters are on a -8-to-8-grade scale. Watching them 1-to-1 one cannot see any direct correlation between 2 parameters, that's why I considered I needed to examine it with ML algorithms.

I made a violin plot where one can see the different distributions of the parameters.
